Prep notes: 

To start a server, open Terminal and type: `python3 -m http.server`

Then go into your web browser and visit http://localhost:8000/ and navigate to the class folder.

You'll also want to open Sublime Text and go to File-Open, click once on the folder name, and click the open button. That should open all the files for the class for you to navigate.
