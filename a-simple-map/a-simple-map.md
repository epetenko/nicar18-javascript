# Part 3: A Simple Map
Come join two ladies from the NJ.com data team as we explain how to make a simple D3 map.

The final product will look like: 
![Poverty rate](simple-d3-map.svg)

Prep notes: 

To start a server, open Terminal and type: `python3 -m http.server`

Then go into your web browser and visit http://localhost:8000/ and navigate to the class folder.

You'll also want to open Sublime Text and go to File-Open, click once on the folder name, and click the open button. That should open all the files for the class for you to navigate.

## Reference chunks

### Chunk one: Create the canvas

```javascript
// First step: create the canvas we will paint on with our data. We start by defining the size of that canvas.
var width = 960,
    height = 600;

// Create GeoPath function that uses built-in D3 functionality to turn
// lat/lon coordinates into screen coordinates
var path = d3.geoPath()

//Now, we tell d3 to build that canvas for us in the body of the html document. Using d3's special syntax, we tell it to find the "body", 
//add on an svg, 
//Make that svg the right width and height, 
//add on a "g" or group of shapes,
//and give it the class we define in our css.
var svg = d3.select("body")
    .append("svg")
    .attr("width", width)
    .attr("height", height)
    .append('g')
    .attr('class', 'map');
```

### Chunk two: Add the json
```javascript
//Now, we get the stencil. Before we can add data, we need to add the shapes it's gonna be connected to. For that, we use a topoJSON.
//d3 has a ready-made function to read in json data, and even has a pre-built state map for us. We just need to read it in and then tell d3 to run the function to handle it.
d3.json("https://d3js.org/us-10m.v1.json", json_function)

//This function will create the map without any added data. It takes two objects: The error case if the json doesn't read, and the json itself if it does.
function json_function(error, us) {
    //Let's see if it worked. If this runs properly, it should return a list of the states and their shape parameters.
    console.log(us.objects.states)
    if (error) throw error;
    //We again tell d3 to manipulate the svg to draw the map. In this one, we tell it to
    //add on another group of shapes (the states),
    //give it a class of "states",
    //Select the path (shape) of the shapes, 
    //give those paths data from the features of our json,
    //add on those paths,
    //and give those paths the geo parameter we created earlier.
    svg.append("g")
        .attr("class", "states")
        .selectAll("path")
        .data(topojson.feature(us, us.objects.states).features)
        .enter().append("path")
        .attr("d", path);

    //Now, we use d3's built-in "mesh" function to create the borders of the states, so that we don't end up with one big US blob. 
    //We add on a new path (the borders),
    //Give them the css class we define,
    //and point it to where to look. The function here tells d3 not to repeat border drawings so we don't get double borders.
    svg.append("path")
        .attr("class", "state-borders")
        .attr("d", path(topojson.mesh(us, us.objects.states, function(a, b) {
            return a !== b;
        })));
};
```

### Chunk three: Add the data
```javascript

//Part Two, Explain how D3 reads csv
//Out comes the paint. Here, we read in the csv with d3's built-in function and tell it to run our function

d3.csv("poverty_data.csv", ready)

//Let's test it to see how it reads that data.
function ready(data) {
    //Check your console: The csv has been returned as a json.
    console.log(data);
    //Now, we tell d3 to select paragraphs,
    //grab the data and add it to p,
    //And generate text for each data point (d) with a function.
    d3.select("body").selectAll("p")
        .data(data)
        .enter()
        .append("p")
        .text(function(d) {
            //A note on data in d3 -- since "d" refers to one row in the csv or one line in the json, 
            //We use the column names and Javascript's bracket notation to access each column for that row.
            //Then we write it out by combining strings with the data into one big paragraph.
            return 'State: ' + d['GEO.display-label'] + ' (id: ' + d['GEO.id2'] + ') has a poverty rate of ' + d['HC03_EST_VC01'] + '%';
        });
}
```

### Part four: Use d3.queue to put them together and add color

For this to work, you must delete the code from Parts two and three, while keeping Part one code in place at the top.
```javascript

// Part Three using Queue to load the external json and csv files

//We're going to combine both trace and paint into one colored map.
//First, we use queue to speed up and simplify the process of loading map and data.
//We tell it to run our function after they're ready.
https: //unpkg.com/us-atlas@1.0.2/us/10m.json
    queue()
    .defer(d3.json, "us.json")
    .defer(d3.csv, "poverty_data.csv")
    .await(makemap);


function makemap(error, us, data) {
    //In case there's an error.
    if (error) throw error;

    //Here are the quantitative variables that we need to read to create the map. First, we create empty variables that we're going to fill with our data.
    var poverty_pct = {};
    var poverty_num = {};

    //Now, for each row in the data, we define our variables, telling d3 which columns to look for. The + sign indicates that they need to be converted into numbers, rather than strings. 
    data.forEach(function(d) {
        poverty_pct[d["GEO.id2"]] = +d.HC03_EST_VC01;
        poverty_num[d["GEO.id2"]] = +d.HC02_EST_VC01;
    });

    //Next, we pick out paint colors. We first tell d3 what numbers to look for when creating stops...
    var color_domain = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
    //Then we tell it what colors to output based on those stops.
    var color_scale = d3.scaleThreshold()
        .domain(color_domain)
        .range(["#f2f0f7", "#dadaeb", "#bcbddc", "#9e9ac8", "#756bb1", "#54278f"]);

    //We start with the same stenciling in that we did above
    svg.append("g")
        .attr("class", "states")
        .selectAll("path")
        .data(topojson.feature(us, us.objects.states).features)
        .enter().append("path")
        .attr("d", path)
        .style("fill", function(d) {
            //But we add in another feature: Painting in the map with the colors we picked before and using the data columns we already defined.
            return color_scale(poverty_pct[d.id]);
        })
        .style("opacity", 0.8)
    //We can also style the feature by, say, giving the features transparency.

    //The same code as before, to create borders.
    svg.append("path")
        .attr("class", "state-borders")
        .attr("d", path(topojson.mesh(us, us.objects.states, function(a, b) {
            return a !== b;
        })));

    console.log("We did it!")
}
```
